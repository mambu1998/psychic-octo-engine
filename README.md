-Description:
Basically this website means that when a blind comes to a website he may not be able to read the text on the website but the website will the audio feature and he would be able to head all the content we have on the page vividly.
This website contains info about the sections about:
-Search Engine Optimization
-Online Reputation Management
-Social Media Marketing

    The other thing I did here is that I got rid of the meaningless <div></div> tags here and wrote the meaningful tags for the div naming convention like header, main, aside, section, footer and articile.

    The code follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

<div>
    <img src="images/pic1.PNG">
    <img src="images/pic2.PNG">
    <img src="images/pic3.PNG">
</div>
